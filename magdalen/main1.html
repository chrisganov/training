<!-- Fix you indent. Golden Rule: If it is nested it should have 1 inner indent from his parent element-->

<!-- You are confusing the <h1> - <h6> and <p>. 
    h1, h2, h3... etc are used for headings(titles)
    p is used for paragraphs - the main text of the article.
    In other words:
    Zaglavie pishesh s ot h1 do h6, p se izpolzva samo za paragrafi i glavni tekstote.

    Example:

    <h2>Hacksaw Brushes</h2> - This is the title
    This is the paragraph text - <p>Made of the highest quality oak,Hacksaw brushes are known for their weight and ability to hold paint in large amounts.Avaiable in different sizes.<span class="brushes">Starting at $3.00/brush.</span></p>
