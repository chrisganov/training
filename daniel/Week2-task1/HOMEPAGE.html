                    <p>World of Warcraft started its journey almost 15 years ago, and Classic is an authentic recreation of the game state back then. It is a cruel and sometimes frustrating old-school MMO that shall be brought back by Blizzard on 27th of August, 2019. We bet you already know everything about this game, so should you wish to skip running on your feet until level 40, grinding mobs or corpserunning through STV, our wow classic boost service is here to get you rid of it.</p>
