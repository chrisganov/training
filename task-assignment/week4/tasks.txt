All tasks should be created in separate .js files.

Task1:

You need to create 4 functions (all arrow functions) with the folliwing logic:

1. getUserChoice which takes one argument. The argument will be expected to be a string.
Make sure that firs you transform that argument to lower case, so there are no issues or erros.
Create a conditional statement inside the functions that checks what is the arguement using the following logic:
if the argument is 'rock', 'paper' or 'scissors' return the argument
if none of the above conditions are met, return a string stating what is the user's choices.

2. getComputerChoice which takes no arguments.
Inside it, you should generate a random number between 0 and 2.
Create a conditional statement which takes the number as argument and write the following logic:
0 - return 'rock'
1 - return 'paper'
2 - return 'scissors'

3. determineWinner which takes two arguments - the user's choice and the computer's choice.
Inside it, write the following conditional logic:

if the computer choice is the same as the user's choice, return 'Game is a tie!'.

Then add some additional logic based on the game "rock, paper, scissors" returning the folloing strings
if if the compute wins return "Computer Won."
if the user wins return "User Won."

No steps will be provided for the above conditionals since the game is known by everyone -> try to write it by yourselves

4. playGame which takes one argument, which will be the input from the user.
Create a variable which will indicate the users choice by calling the getUserChoice function and provide it with the argument of this function
Create a variable which will indicate the compute's choice by calling the getComputerChoice functinons
Log in the console the following strings:

"User threw: {the use variable}"
"Computer threw: {the computer variable}"
"{Who won based on the determineWinner function} "

5. Call the playGame function with a string -> test your function a couple of times to check if it works as expected

Task2:

You have the following array:

let secretMessage = ['Learning', 'is', 'not', 'about', 'what', 'you', 'get', 'easily', 'the', 'first', 'time,', 'it', 'is', 'about', 'what', 'you', 'can', 'figure', 'out.', '-Probably said it once at some point,', 'Ivo', 'Dukov,', 'Learn', 'JavaScript'];

You need to:

1. Remove the last idex using an array method
2. Add the strings "to" and "Program" at the end of the array using an array method
3. Change the 7th index of the array with 'right' using an array method
4. Remove the first index of the array using an array method
5. Add the string "Programming" at the beggining of the array using an array method
6. log the array in the console to see how it looks and if all of the above have been completed.
7. Remove the following strings "get, right, the, first, time" and replace them with 'know' using only one array method
8. Log in the console a string that has joined all of the strings with a white space using an array method

Task3

You have the following string:

const input = 'samurai life above all';

You need to:

1. Create a variable called "vowels" which is an array which holds the english vowels (google them if you dont know them. Hint: "y" is not a vowel)
2. Create a variable called resultArray which is an empty array.
3. Create a loop with the following logic:
  a. Inside it as a condition:  initiate a variable called inputIndex which is equal to 0, while inputIndex is lower than the input's length, increase inputeIndex by 1
  b. Inside the loop create a second loop:
    i. Inside it as a condition: initiate a  variable called vowelsIndex which is equal to 0, while vowelsIndex is lower than vowels's length, increase vowelsIndex by 1
    ii. If input with index inputIndex is the same as the vowels with index vowelsIndex, push the input with index inputIndex in resultArray
  c. If input with index inputIndex is equal to "e" or "u", push the input with index inputIndex into the resultArray
4. Create a variable called whaleTranslate which is equal to the resultArray which is joined without any whitespace and are all capital letters
5. Log in the console the whaleTranslate varaibel

Expected result should be: AUUAIIEEAOEEA
