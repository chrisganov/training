You will extend the knowledge you have had acquired from last week. Time for a new website!

The first part of this will be to CREATE a new website to your liking - similar to the last weeks one where it was selling brushes and paint - change it to something you like - gaming, cars - it does not matter.

There is a catch... you need to customize the new website using MaterializeCSS Framework. You will find navigation how to do that in the resources folder.

1. Change all of the pictures to represent the thing of your liking.
2. Change the overall layout - background color, ribbon color, text, name of the page etc.
3. Create a fixed header that stays always on the top of the page even if you scroll down.
3a. Make sure that the header contains 3 links:

- HOME: the home will contain the first page when you open the index.html (that is the page you created last week and what you will edit now.

- ABOUT ME: This will contain a new page (a new HTML page called about.html). It will contain only text regarding you. You can either make up some text or write something about yourself - it's your choice. Just make sure that the text has a title, some text, a picture of something (doesn't need to be you). The text should have set some family font, font-size and the title should also be bold.

- Catalog page - create a page that that it will show more of what you are making the website about - add pictures, some prices - depends completely on what you are making the website about (a new file catalog.html). Add more pictures than those from the home page so it can show the product/theme you are talking about and also add some information about each product/theme.

- CONTACT ME: This page will contain a form on how a person can contact you. It should be a third file called contact.html. You will find instructions how to make a form in the resources. The form should contain:

	- First Name field.
	- Last Name field.
	- Gender (radio button).
	- Number field.
	- Text area for message.
	- Button for submitting the message

	NOTE: All of the fields must be required.

Make sure that the website is responsive - the height and width should be scaled properly.
Utilize the whole html page, do not leave floating text. Be creative. Make it so it looks good.
