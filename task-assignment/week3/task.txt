 Each task should be done in a different .js file
 
 Task1:
 Create a variable called kelvin and set it to 0.
 Create a variable called celsius and set it to kelvin minus 273
 Create a variable farenheit and set it to a whole number which is equal to celsius times the result of the devision of 9 and 5 plus 32
 Create a variable newton and set it to a whole number which is equal to celsius times the result of the devision of 33 and 100
 
 Test if it works, by changin the kelvin to some number and then google a converter to check if all variables are correct.

 All of these variables should be loged in the console the logic has been written (ex: The result of The temperature is (variable result) degrees in (variable name)`

 The strings should be done in two ways - using the standart concat string and using Template strings
 
 Task 2:
 Create a variable that is equal to your current age.
 Creeate a varaiable that is equal to 2 called earlyYears
 Reassign earlyYears to be equal to the current value of earlyYears times 10.5
 Create a variable that is equal to your age times 4 called laterYears
 Reassign laterYears to be equal the current value of laterYears times 4
 Add laterYears and earlyYears to a new variable called myDogYears
 Create a variable with your name written as a string in lower case letters
 Use the build in functions for strings to capitalize the first letter of your name (google how it)
 Log the folling string in the console (using a template string) "My name is (your name). I am (your age) years old in human years which is (your dog age) years old in dog years."
