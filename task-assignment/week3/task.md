 <u>Each task should be done in a different .js file</u>
 
 **Task1:**
- Create a variable called kelvin and set it to 0.
- Create a variable called celsius and set it to kelvin minus 273
- Create a variable farenheit and set it to a whole number which is equal to celsius times the result of the devision of 9 and 5 plus 32
- Create a variable newton and set it to a whole number which is equal to celsius times the result of the devision of 33 and 100
 
*  Test if it works, by changin the kelvin to some number and then google a converter to check if all variables are correct.

 * All of these variables should be loged in the console the logic has been written (ex: The result of The temperature is {variable result} degrees in {variable name}`

 * The strings should be done in two ways - using the standart concat string and using Template strings

**Task 2:**
 - Create a variable that is equal to your current age.
 - Creeate a varaiable that is equal to 2 called earlyYears
 - Reassign earlyYears to be equal to the current value of earlyYears times 10.5
 - Create a variable that is equal to your age times 4 called laterYears
 - Reassign laterYears to be equal the current value of laterYears times 4
 - Add laterYears and earlyYears to a new variable called myDogYears
 - Create a variable with your name written as a string in lower case letters
 - Use the build in functions for strings to capitalize the first letter of your name (google how it)
 - Log the folling string in the console (using a template string) "My name is (your name). I am (your age) years old in human years which is (your dog age) years old in dog years."

 
**Task 3:**
- Create a variable that is equal to a whole number which is a random number times 8
- Create a variable that is called eightBall

- Create a conditional statement that checks which is the random number and depending on the response it  should be reassigned to eightBall as it follows:

  - 0: It is certain
  - 1: It is certain
  - 2: Reply hazy try again
  - 3: Cannot predict now
  - 4: Do not count on it
  - 5: My sources say no
  - 6: Outlook not so good
  - 7: Signs point to yes

- log in the console eightBall variable

**Task4:**

- create 3 variables:
  - number -  one that is a  random whole number between 0 and 1000
  - early - true
  - age - 18

- Create two conditionals folling the below rules:

- if it is early and the age is bigger than or equal to 18, log in the console the (number)  and add 1000 more. Add the number in a new variable called "earlyNumber"

- if it is early and age is bigger or equal to  18 -> log -> Race starts at 9:30 am. Your Number is (earlyNumber);
- if it is not early and age is bigger than or eqaul to 18 -> log -> Race starts at 11:00 am. Your Number is (number)
- if age is less than 18 -> log -> Race starts at 12:30 pm. You number is (number)
- if none of the conditions above are met -> log -> Please see the registration desk
