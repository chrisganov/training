      <h2>Vani Hypercars</h2>
      <h3>1991</h3>
      <p>
        Vani Hypercars story is one of humble beginnings, dedication to a vision and an unyielding commitment to
        automotive perfection. Take a look at the timeline below to see where we’ve come from. The only story
        more exciting than where we’ve been is where we’re going in the future!
      </p>
      <p>
        Like any startup, Vani Hypercars was not easy. <br>
        The reason was that the idea of introducing super cars to fans was actually born earlier ,<br> than the
        super cars themselves. </p>
      <h3>14 July 1996</h3>
      <p>
        After the first 5 difficult years, the first car that was introduced to our fans was Koenigsegg CC. <br>
        Driven in public for the first time by Rickard Rydell at an event at Anderstorp race track in 1996. <br>
        All were amazed by the Koenigsegg’s outstanding performance. <br>
        The concept worked. It was time to introduce Koenigsegg to prospective buyers.
